>This project was completed as part of the course requirements of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree certification.

<a id='intro'></a>
## Introduction


>In this project, I will analyze a dataset and then communicate with my findings. I have to use Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis on the dataset easier. I choose the TMDb movie dataset which contains information about 10,000 movies collected in the movie database (TMDb). Itâ€™s originally come from Kaggle which was cleaned and provided by Udacity that includes movie information such as popularity, budget, cast, user rating, revenue and vote average. 

## Objectives
>The main concept of this project is to through the data analysis techniques based in the following steps:

><li>Ask questions</li>
><li>Data wrangling</li>
><li>Exploratory data analysis</li>
><li>Conclusion</li>

## Questions

>These are the questions that I analyzed from the dataset:
><ol>
    <li>What is the movie with the highest and lowest budget?</li>
    <li>Which movie made the highest revenue and lowest?</li>
    <li>What is the movie with the shortest and longest runtime?</li>
    <li>What is the most and least profit earned in the movies?</li>
    <li>Which movie has the highest or lowest profit earned?</li>
