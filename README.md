# <h1 style="text-align:center;">Data Analysis Project 2 - Investigate a Dataset (TMDb Movie Dataset)</h1>


>This project was completed as part of the course requirements of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree certification.


# Introduction

In this project, I will analyze a dataset and then communicate with my findings. I have to use Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis on the dataset easier. I choose the TMDb movie dataset which contains information about 10,000 movies collected in the movie database (TMDb). Itâ€™s originally come from Kaggle which was cleaned and provided by Udacity that includes movie information such as popularity, budget, cast, user rating, revenue and vote average. 

# Objectives
>The main concept of this project is to through the data analysis techniques based in the following steps:

* Ask questions
* Data wrangling
* Exploratory data analysis
* Conclusion

# Questions

>These are the questions that I analyzed from the dataset:

   - What is the movie with the highest and lowest budget?
   - Which movie made the highest revenue and lowest?
   - What is the movie with the shortest and longest runtime?
   - What is the most and least profit earned in the movies?
   - Which movie has the highest or lowest profit earned?
   - What is the average runtime of movies from year to year?
   - Which genres have the highest release of movies?
    
# Technologies Used

- Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib
- Excel
- Jupyter Notebooks
